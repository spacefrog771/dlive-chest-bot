This plugin is for use on Dlive. It simulates the click on the Chest when it

pops up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Brower extension is only for the Firefox Browser so far.

A google - chrome Version might be available in the future.

I might or might not publish it in their respective extension stores.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This firefox extension so far only works in debug mode.

To run it, go to "Manage Your Extensions" in Firefox.

Select "Debug Add-Ons" => "Load Temporary Add On", then select the file with the .xpi extension.

Once it is running, it outputs "looking for chest" in the Javascript console every 1.5 seconds.

Once the extension is active, it will scan all dlive tabs for chest events appearing.

You need to follow the channels for this extension to work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The source-code is the file autochest.js.

The .xpi file is a zip archive with that javascript code file plus a json file for

plugin meta definitions, an icon and this README.md.
