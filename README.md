## PURPOSE

This Extension / Add-On / Plugin is for use on Dlive. It simulates the click on the Chest when it

pops up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## INFO

This Browser extension is only for the Firefox Browser so far.

A google - chrome Version might be available in the future.

I might or might not publish it in their respective extension stores.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## INSTALLATION AS TEMPORARY EXTENSION

As long as this plugin is not listed on Mozilla, it is only available as temporary debug extension.

To run it go to "Add on and Themes" to manage your Extensions.

Select "Debug Add-Ons" => "Load Temporary Add On", then select the file with the .xpi extension.

That's it. Once it is running it outputs "looking for chest" in the Javascript console every 1.5 seconds.

Once the extension is active, it will scan all dlive tabs for chest events appearing

and perform a click on it.

You need to follow the channels for this extension to work.

To disable it simply remove it.

## SOURCE / FILES

The source-code is the file autochest.js.

The .xpi file is a zip archive with that javascript code file plus a json file for

plugin meta definitions, an icon and this README.md.
